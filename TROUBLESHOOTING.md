# ðŸš¨ Important Notes

## Current Issues:

### 1. OpenAI API Quota Exceeded
Your OpenAI API key has no remaining credits. You need to:
- Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Add a payment method 
- Purchase credits (usually $5-10 is enough for many blog posts)

### 2. Medium Integration Token Missing
The Medium API integration tokens might not be available in your settings because:
- Medium may have restricted API access
- Your account might need to be upgraded
- The feature might be deprecated

## Alternative Solutions:

### For OpenAI:
1. **Add billing to your OpenAI account** (recommended)
2. **Use OpenAI free tier** if available
3. **Try other AI services** like Hugging Face, Anthropic, etc.

### For Medium:
1. **Manual posting**: Generate content locally, then copy-paste to Medium
2. **Use other platforms**: Dev.to, Hashnode, Ghost, etc.
3. **Try Medium Partner Program**: Some features require membership

## Next Steps:

1. **Fix OpenAI billing** first
2. **Test content generation** 
3. **Research Medium API** alternatives
4. **Consider other publishing platforms**

## Quick Test (Once OpenAI is fixed):
```bash
cd /Users/aseshnemal/Desktop/app/DailyMuse
python3 test_blog_bot.py
```

This will generate a blog post and save it as an HTML file that you can then manually post to Medium.
